# The Portrayal of Netanyahu in Western media

### Project Description

In this project, we aim to take a birdâ€™s-eye view of the information consumed by North American audiences regarding political figure Netanyahu. Our focus is not on analyzing potential biases in article titles or their nuanced formulations but rather on providing a broader perspective by identifying recurrent patterns in media coverage.

Through a data-driven approach, we seek to analyze how Netanyahu is portrayed in North American media, examining overarching sentiment and key coverage topics to uncover underlying framing tendencies. By highlighting these general trends, we hope to inspire curiosity and encourage
deeper exploration into the nuances of media framing and its implications.
